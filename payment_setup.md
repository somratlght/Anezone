# Payment Setup (notes)
- This starter includes mock endpoints. For production:
  - Sign up for bKash merchant, Nagad merchant, SSLCOMMERZ.
  - Obtain sandbox/test API keys.
  - Implement server-side callbacks (webhooks) to confirm payments.
  - Never store raw card or wallet PIN data on your server.
